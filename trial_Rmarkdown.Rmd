## Hello World!
I've set-up my first R Notebook and published on Github pages. Here is me documenting my progress on setting up the R Notebook and my attempt to process scRNAseq data. This is a work in progress and meant for organizing what I've learned. 

## Setting up R Markdown: trial

After following instructions on <https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/>, here is the start of my Rnotebook set-up. Just trying things out now!

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars) # The first trial was to just run the code on Rmarkdown and publish
a <- 1
a # The second was to make edits to the file and publish
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure) # The third was to generate a plot 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
